# HackathonProject

Our plan for this project was to make a website that would cater specifically
toward clubs. At our school, some of our clubs were unorganized and many times
many students had constant conflicts between clubs. So we decided to try to make
a website in which each student can sign up and log in.

Any president of the club would then be able to put the upcoming events into the calendar.
As a result all of the students part of that club would receive the results in their
calendar.

NOTE: For the Calendar portion of the project we had to use online help for a lot of it.
We used a plugin for the calendar, but used our own code to enter them into the calendar.
